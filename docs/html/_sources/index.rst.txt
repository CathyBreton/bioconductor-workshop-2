Workshop Topics
===============

This workshop, 'Analyses of RNA-seq and ChiP-seq with R/Bioconductor', is designed to expand upon the Bioconductor training provided in the first Bioconductor workshop; it is an intermediate-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop.  The topics presented herein include the following:

* Standard analyses for RNA-seq Data
   * Approaches to processing raw data from RNA seq experiments
   * Annotating and importing expression counts
   * Basic exploratory data analysis
   * Assessing model fit and dispersion

* Gene-wise Testing in Depth, Including Multiple Testing
   * Differential expression analysis with the 'edgeR' package
   * Comparison of the 'edgeR' and 'DESeq2' packages for differential expression analysis
   * Hypothesis testing for count data
   * Approaches to multiple hypothesis testing result correction (e.g. false discovery rate calculation)
   * Visualizing differentially expressed genes/transcripts

* Gene Set Analysis
   * Over-representation analysis
   * Gene set enrichment analysis
   * Network-based enrichment analysis
   * Region-based enrichment analysis
   * Resources for these types of analyses (e.g. GO, KEGG, MSigDb)

* Analyses of ChIP-seq Data
   * Introduction to standard approaches used in ChIP Seq
   * Analyses for peak calling
   * Calculation of differential binding across samples
   * The annotation and plotting of peaks


Purpose
=======

This site hosts the Jupyter notebooks for the CBC Bioconductor Workshop 2.  The notebooks will be served on the web as static HTML pages, meaning that while they looks like live notebooks, they cannot be edited.  To obtain an editable copy of the notebook files, please click the respective 'Download Notebook' link below.  These 4 notebooks were created by Levi Waldron.
