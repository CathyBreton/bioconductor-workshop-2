Bioconductor Workshop 2 Notebook Directory
==========================================

For this workshop, each attendee has been assigned a temporary Amazon instance running a Jupyter notebook.  Jupyter notebooks allow the user to run R code on the cloud under entirely homogenous system conditions, meaning nobody is likely to encounter unexpected errors due to having different system configurations.

Please locate your name in the list below and click on the link to access your instance.  The password to open Jupyter is 'cobre'.

Please note that this frame will only become active the morning of the workshop; until that time, it will yield a 404 error as the directory will have not yet been generated.  That way we will be able to best accommodate late registrants and ensure everybody is correctly assigned an instance.
